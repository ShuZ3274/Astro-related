EDITOR: SHU
CONTEXT:
    RK4 method added (somehow its performance is worse than Euler, stil need development)
    3d graphing in the testEnv, with jupiter added




DATE: 2023-11-24 16:36
EDITOR: SHU
CONTEXT:
    An animation in 2d added (with 2 tracer particles)
COMMENT:
    I would like to add another class beside from planet, which they don't contribute to gravity field
    But that will change a lot to the current updating scheme,
    it's better we do it together.


DATE: 2023-11-25 22:22
EDITOR: LUCA
CONTEXT:
    New class SolarSystemPM partially created.
COMMENT:
    Whole new class created to handle particle-mesh calculations, methods include grid initializer, mass to density gridder, potential solver, force calculator. 
    Also added getRadius() to planet class.

DATE: 2023-11-26 17:45
EDITOR: LUCA
CONTEXT:
    New class SolarSystemPMBH partially created.
COMMENT:
    Whole new class created to handle Barnes-Hut method calculations, took QuadTree and BH algo from Aaron Nguyen on GitHub https://github.com/ntta/barnes-hut-algorithm 
    and modified it for our purposes, partially implemented with our objects and nomenclature, yet to test...



DATE: 2023-11-29 01:58
EDITOR: SHU
CONTEXT:
    GR mode of orbit added
    Tested with mercury orbit, 2d animation in test.mp4
COMMENT:
    It works fine, the semimajpr axis shows angular shift in with time.


DATE: 2023-11-30 11:00
EDITOR: LUCA
CONTEXT:
    Added new file for our implementation of Barnes-Hut algorithm, Node2 class created to support QuadTree in SolarSystemPMBH, mostly implemented.
COMMENT:
    Next step check that tree creation works and create methods for force calculation, need to look into tree traversal methods, intuition says DFS.

DATE: 2023-12-01 1:00
EDITOR: LUCA
CONTEXT:
    Barnes-Hut implementation complete, finalized methods for computing forces, and taking steps, including with a new Leapfrog integration option, just need and implementation of Orbit().
COMMENT:
    Yet to be debugged and/or tested, awaiting group feedback.


DATE: 2023-12-01 16:00
EDITOR: LUCA
CONTEXT:
    Barnes-Hut implementation debugged, still work to do.
COMMENT:
    Currently working on out of bbox error when creating tree.

DATE: 2023-12-02 14:00
EDITOR: LUCA
CONTEXT:
    Barnes-Hut visualization tool created, debugging of bbox errors also fixed by small logic rework in getQuad().
COMMENT:
    Ready for larger scale testing.

DATE: 2023-12-02 16:45
EDITOR: LUCA, SARA, SHU
CONTEXT:
    Barnes-Hut tree creation and force calculation testing (multiple, but low number of objects, n = 15)
COMMENT:
    Ready for larger scale testing, think about implementing 'flag' for escaped bodies to exclude them from tree.

DATE: 2023-12-04 08:05
EDITOR: LUCA
CONTEXT:
    Large scale setup with Trojans, Hildas, main belt created, algorithmic analysis performed, results as expected for BH and PP. 
    Small fix so that a body out of bounds does not cause the program to halt.
COMMENT:
    Need to perform long term time evolution of new system setup, also properly analyze runtimes and check against theoretical limit, 
    expect worse than NlogN since we have dense clustering in small areas of the domain making the average tree depth greater than log_4 N.


DATE: 2023-12-05 02:10
EDITOR: SHU
CONTEXT:
    Test_GR renamed to Mercury_w_GR, added test of errors with different number of steps
    jupyter notebook named Mercury added, the analysis of error behaviours 
    mercury_pos renamed mercury_ap_peri, now only record aphelion/perihelion data instead of entire trajectory
COMMENT:
    RK4 method stil not working porperly, I will put this in disscussion.

DATE 2023-12-05 12:00
EDITOR: SARA
CONTEXT:
    BHV2 renamed to BHClass, unused/imcomplete code moved to archive (barneshut.py, particle mesh simulation)
    Removed redundencies and added comments for legibility
COMMENT:
    TestEnvironment.py still needs some structuring.

    RK4 method is working poeperly now
