FOLDER: Python_methods
CONTENT: many numerical methods I learned, with implementation examples


FOLDER: Simulation_of_solar_system
CONTENT: A numerical simulation of some unique motions in solar system, including asteroid belt’s triangular motion, trojan asteroid in Jupiter’s orbit and the perihelion precession of Mercury. 
        The method is based on object-oriented Python coding, assisted with Barne-hut algorithm to boost efficiency when encountering large N-body problem. Also using integration method like leapfrog and Rung-Kutta to reduce deviation accumulated over large time scale.


File: Dark_Energy_and_Mathematical_Model.pdf
CONTENT: A study of evidence of the existence of dark energy, starting with deriving relativistic model of universe from scratch, then providing observational evidence to prove possibility. Discussion extended to the ongoing great challenge in cosmology, Hubble tension, with analysis of Planck CMB surveys and Riess observation of supernova redshift. End with imposition of changing dark energy density.
